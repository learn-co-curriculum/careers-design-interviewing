# Design Interviewing

These are an unavoidable part of interviewing for most entry-level jobs now. Employers want to make sure you have the skills you listed on your résumé. 

They usually fall into two categories:

**Design challenges**, which are exercises that require enough time to ask you to go home, or work alone for a while, then come back and present your deliverables.

**Whiteboard challenges**, which are exercises that happen live, in the room with people from that company.

Refer to Mod 5 content for the full content on how to prepare for the design challenges during interviews.
